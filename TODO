# PLAN / TODO LIST

- must implement vector search and an alternative endpoint to enable both full-text and vector search; because an ES license is required for semantic search and combined with full-text search using Reciprocal Rank Fusion (https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions)
  - change es_client.py to vector search, not semantic search.
  - edit es_client.py Search() class search() method to enable to types of search without RRF; depending on searchtype chosen as option in front-end.
  - add if-statement to Flask handle_search() to enable the two types of searches in index.html.
- reconsider whether data should be mounted as a volume rather than copied
